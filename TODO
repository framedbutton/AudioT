This is a TODO file for both the client and server sides of the tale:

Client:
- implement a database of songs in the library/temp dir
- implement threading
- assymetric transfer
- benchmarking capability
- stats transfer

Server:
- gui
- conversion pool
- multiple clients
- cdparanoia ripping
- ability to be fed files from the internet/torrent (aria2?)
- fallback mode to set up a client using ssh 
    - stats set using a text file polling every interval
    - an option to run the client persistently in screen(?)
- fed options from a config file
